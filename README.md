# py-sdk

Ok, so this is an attempt at a python based sdk to interact with Pocketbase.
Currently not working, and requires some TLC to get it to a stable condition.
General motivation was simple: despite the fact that Django, Flask, FastAPI
and a thousand other frameworks exist to spin-up a web service in Python,
they still have a fairly sizeable learning curve for anyone new to the language.
In theory, this should make it somewhat trivial to create a simple microservice with
a CRUD component and modern/secure/common authorization methods.

# Pocketbase:

# Pocketbase Javascript/Typescript SDK:

# Pocketbase Dart SDK:
https://github.com/pocketbase/dart-sdk

Would love some help, and a few pointers if anyone out there would like to get this
package into a state that's suitable for a proper release
